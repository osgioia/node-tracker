## üìö Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

1. **Create the first admin user:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "secure_password_123",
    "inviteKey": "bootstrap"
  }'
```

2. **Login to get authentication token:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "secure_password_123"
  }'
```

### User Management

#### Create an invitation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invitations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "reason": "New community member",
    "expiresInDays": 7
  }'
```

#### Register with invitation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "newuser",
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "password": "user_password_123",
    "inviteKey": "<invitation_key_received>"
  }'
```

### User Ratio System

The tracker includes a comprehensive ratio system that tracks user upload/download statistics:

#### View user profile with ratio:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

**Response includes:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "user123",
    "uploaded": 5368709120,    // 5 GB in bytes
    "downloaded": 2684354560,  // 2.5 GB in bytes
    "seedtime": 86400,         // 24 hours in seconds
    "ratio": 2.0               // Calculated automatically
  },
  "stats": {
    "torrentsUploaded": 5,
    "totalUploaded": 5368709120,
    "totalDownloaded": 2684354560,
    "ratio": 2.0
  }
}
```

#### How ratio works:
- **Ratio = Uploaded √∑ Downloaded**
- **Perfect ratio:** 1.0 (equal upload/download)
- **Good ratio:** > 1.0 (more upload than download)
- **Needs improvement:** < 1.0 (more download than upload)
- **New users:** 0.0 (no downloads yet)

### User Ban System

Advanced user management with temporary and permanent bans:

#### Ban user for 7 days:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/quick/7-days \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 123,
    "reason": "Spam in chat repeatedly"
  }'
```

#### Ban user for 15 days:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/quick/15-days \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 456,
    "reason": "Toxic behavior towards other users"
  }'
```

#### Ban user permanently (Admin only):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/quick/permanent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 789,
    "reason": "Severe violation of community guidelines"
  }'
```

#### Ban user for custom duration:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 101,
    "reason": "Multiple rule violations",
    "days": 5
  }'
```

#### Unban user (deactivate ban):

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/1/deactivate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

#### Check user ban status:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/user/123/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

#### List all bans with filters:

```bash
# All active bans
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans?active=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

# Bans by specific admin
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans?bannedBy=admin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

# Bans for specific user
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans?userId=123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

#### Clean up expired bans (Admin only):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user-bans/cleanup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

### Torrent Management

#### Add a torrent:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/torrents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -d '{
    "infoHash": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
    "name": "My Awesome Torrent",
    "category": "Movies",
    "description": "A great movie torrent",
    "tags": ["action", "2024"]
  }'
```

#### Search torrents:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/torrents?search=awesome&category=Movies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

### Tracker Usage

#### BitTorrent Client Configuration:

- **Announce URL:** `http://localhost:3000/announce`
- **Scrape URL:** `http://localhost:3000/scrape`

#### Manual announce (for testing):

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/announce?info_hash=<20_byte_hash>&peer_id=<20_byte_peer_id>&port=6881&uploaded=0&downloaded=0&left=1000000&event=started"
```

## üß© How the System Works

### General Flow

1. **Controlled Registration:** Users can only register through invitations. Existing users with permissions can generate invitations for others.

2. **Authentication:** Users log in with username and password. JWT tokens are used to authenticate and authorize each request.

3. **Torrent Management:** Authenticated users can add, search, and manage torrents. Administrators can view and manage all torrents.

4. **Role-based Permissions:**
   - **USER:** Can use the tracker, upload torrents, and view their own content
   - **MODERATOR:** Can moderate content and manage users/torrents
   - **ADMIN:** Full system control, users, invitations, and configuration

5. **Security Features:**
   - Rate limiting, data validation, password hashing, and IP banning
   - Access to critical routes restricted by role authorization

6. **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics and structured logging for system auditing and monitoring

### Invitation System Deep Dive

The invitation system controls who can register on the tracker:

1. **Invitation Generation:**
   - Only authenticated users (usually ADMIN or MODERATOR) can create invitations via API (`POST /api/invitations`)
   - You can specify email, reason, and optional expiration (days of validity)
   - Each invitation generates a unique code (inviteKey) sent to the invitee

2. **Registration with Invitation:**
   - The invited user must register using the received invitation code
   - The system validates that the invitation is active, unused, and not expired
   - Upon successful registration, the invitation is marked as used and cannot be reused

3. **Control and Auditing:**
   - Administrators can list, revoke, or delete invitations
   - All invitations are logged with their status (used, active, expired)

**Benefits:**
- Maintains a closed and secure community
- Prevents mass or automated registrations
- Provides traceability of who invited whom

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Models

### Core Models

- **User:** User accounts, roles, authentication, ratio tracking (uploaded, downloaded, seedtime)
- **UserBan:** Advanced user banning system with temporary and permanent bans
- **Torrent:** Torrent metadata, categories, statistics
- **Invite:** Invitation system management
- **IPBan:** IP address banning
- **Bookmark:** User bookmarks/favorites
- **Progress:** User download progress tracking

### New Ratio & Ban Features

#### User Model Extensions:
- `uploaded`: Total bytes uploaded by user (BigInt)
- `downloaded`: Total bytes downloaded by user (BigInt)
- `seedtime`: Total seeding time in seconds (BigInt)
- `ratio`: Automatically calculated (uploaded/downloaded)

#### UserBan Model:
- `userId`: Reference to banned user
- `reason`: Detailed ban reason (5-500 characters)
- `bannedBy`: Username of admin/moderator who applied ban
- `bannedAt`: Timestamp when ban was applied
- `expiresAt`: Expiration date (null for permanent bans)
- `active`: Whether ban is currently active

### Relationships

- Users can have multiple torrents
- Users can create and use invitations
- Users can have multiple bans (historical record)
- Torrents can be bookmarked by users
- Progress tracks user interaction with torrents
